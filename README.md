- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rishabh Verma
I'm Rishabh Verma, an MBA graduate in Marketing, equipped with 3 years of extensive experience in Sales and Operations. Proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Advanced Excel, I excel in translating complex data into actionable insights.

My role as an Account Investigator at Amazon's Hyderabad office showcased my meticulous eye for detail and analytical finesse. Additionally, I interned as a Data Science intern at Access Million from August to December 2023, where I gained hands-on experience harnessing data for impactful decision-making.

Driven to transition into Data Science and Analysis roles, I merge business acumen with analytical expertise, aiming to steer strategic business growth through data-driven insights. My dedication to precision and passion for leveraging data as a catalyst for informed strategies define my professional approach.
